# Online-Checkout-GUI

An online store checkout GUI simulation. 

This Java application intakes user input and processes it - specifically, the credit card number. 
The credit card number is validated using the Luhn Algorithm, a commonly used verification method for credit card numbers.

A true Boolean value is returned to the application after the user's credit card value passes all checks. 
The application then displays a confimation page.

A false Boolean value is returned if the card number does not pass all of the checks. This will display a red border around
the card number's text field, indicating an error.
